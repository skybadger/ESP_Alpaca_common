# ESP_Alpaca_common
This folder contains the ALPACA API definition code include files for the ESP8266 device implementation 
This should be complete and up to date - recently added AlpacaMgmt.h which contains the code for handling and responding to Alpaca discovery and management calls. 
Recently introduced a dependency on the remote Debugging api since all my code here is beginning to include it, it just worms its way in If you have enabled in the projcet code, it will just work.
